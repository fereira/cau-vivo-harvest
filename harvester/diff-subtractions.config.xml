<%    The diff tool is used to compare jena models and produce a result model which is the first model (minuend)      %>
<%       with any matching statements in the second model (subtrahend) removed from it.                               %>

<%    This tool produces the graph-math difference of the triples between two models. It produces a model with the    %>
